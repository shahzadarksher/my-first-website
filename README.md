# Warshigoom Travels — Starter Website

This repository contains a small static website template for a travel agency focused on Warshigoom.

Files:
- `index.html` — homepage with hero, tours, contact & booking modal.
- `styles.css` — responsive styles.
- `script.js` — lightweight JavaScript for modal and forms.
- `assets/` — put your images here (hero.jpg, tour1.jpg, tour2.jpg, tour3.jpg, etc.)

How to use
1. Clone the repo locally.
2. Replace images in `assets/` with real photos from Warshigoom.
3. Edit text content in `index.html` to include real descriptions, contact details, and prices.
4. If you want server-side bookings, replace the placeholder form handlers in `script.js` with fetch() calls to your backend or a service (e.g., Netlify Functions, Google Forms, or a booking API).

Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Push changes to the `main` branch.
2. In your repository, go to Settings → Pages.
3. Choose the branch (main) and root (/) as source, then Save.
4. Your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (may take a minute).
